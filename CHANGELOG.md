# Changelog - SafetyBot

## [3.0] - 2025-10-25

### 🎯 Major Changes

#### Architecture Shift: Real-Time Alerts → Daily Reporting
- **Removed**: Real-time Telegram messages for each event
- **Added**: Daily Excel report generation with full event details
- **Added**: Event storage system using JSON format
- **Added**: `/getid` command for on-demand reports

#### Event Storage System (NEW)
- New `EventStore` class for managing event data
- Events stored in `events_data/` directory
- One JSON file per day: `events_YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- Full event details captured (type, driver, time, severity, etc.)
- Persistent storage for auditing and reporting

#### Excel Report Generation (NEW)
- New `generate_excel_file()` method
- New `send_excel_file()` method
- New `send_daily_excel()` scheduled task
- Excel files saved with date: `Daily_Report_YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx`
- Professional formatting:
  - Blue header row with white text
  - Formatted columns (optimal widths)
  - All event details included

#### Command Handler (NEW)
- New `handle_getid_command()` method
- Telegram `/getid` command support
- Responds with today's Excel file on demand
- Available any time during the day

#### New Scheduler Jobs
- Daily Excel generation at 23:59 PM
- Event checking every 5 minutes (unchanged)
- Cleanly separated scheduling logic

### 🔧 Bug Fixes

#### CRITICAL: Performance Events Filter Fixed ✅
- **Issue**: `'media_required': 'true'` parameter restricted events to only those with video
- **Fix**: Removed the parameter entirely
- **Result**: Now captures ALL 6 performance event types:
  - ✅ Hard Brake
  - ✅ Crash
  - ✅ Seat Belt Violation
  - ✅ Stop Sign Violation
  - ✅ Distraction
  - ✅ Unsafe Lane Change
- **File**: `fetch_driver_performance_events()` method (lines 313-318)

#### Event Data Extraction
- New `extract_event_data()` method for consistent data formatting
- Handles speeding events with speed/exceeded calculations
- Handles performance events with time/location data
- Error handling with None return on failure

### 📦 New Dependencies

- `openpyxl==3.10.0` - Excel file generation and formatting

### 📚 New Methods

```python
class EventStore:
    def __init__(self, storage_dir='events_data')
    def get_today_file()
    def get_date_file(date_str)
    def load_events(file_path=None)
    def save_event(event_data, file_path=None)

class SafetyBot:
    def extract_event_data(event, event_type) → Dict
    def generate_excel_file(events, date_str=None) → Optional[str]
    def send_excel_file(file_path, date_str=None) → bool
    def handle_getid_command(update, context)
    def send_daily_excel()
```

### 🔄 Modified Methods

- `_process_new_events_async()`: 
  - Changed to store events instead of sending messages
  - Simplified: no video downloads or Telegram formatting
  - Added: calls to `extract_event_data()` and `event_store.save_event()`
  - Cleaner event processing loop

- `run_scheduler()`:
  - Added daily Excel generation scheduling
  - Updated startup messages
  - Better feature documentation in console output

- `format_time()`:
  - Removed import of pytz inside function (now imported at module level)
  - No functional changes

### ❌ Removed Methods

- `format_speeding_message()` - No longer needed (messages not sent individually)
- `format_performance_message()` - No longer needed (messages not sent individually)
- `download_video_to_temp_file()` - No longer downloading videos
- `send_speeding_event_to_telegram()` - No longer sending individual alerts
- `send_performance_event_to_telegram()` - No longer sending individual alerts
- `health_check()` - Removed to focus on reporting model

### 📝 Documentation

- Updated `README.md` with v3.0 features and usage
- Created `SETUP_GUIDE.md` with detailed setup instructions
- Created `CHANGELOG.md` (this file)
- Better documentation of breaking changes

### 📂 New File Structure

```
events_data/
├── events_2025-10-25.json
├── events_2025-10-26.json
└── Daily_Report_2025-10-25.xlsx
```

### 🚀 Performance Improvements

- **Less Network Usage**: No video downloads
- **Faster Processing**: Simpler logic, no media group handling
- **Better Storage**: Structured JSON vs ID files only
- **Lower Memory**: No temporary files or async media operations

### ✨ User-Facing Changes

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Alerts | Individual messages (real-time) | Daily Excel file (23:59) |
| On-demand report | ❌ Not available | ✅ `/getid` command |
| Performance events | Some (only with media) | All 6 types |
| Data retention | Event IDs only | Full event data in JSON |
| Report format | Plain text | Professional Excel |
| Videos | Downloaded & sent | Not sent (focus on reporting) |

### 🧪 Testing Recommendations

1. ✅ Install `openpyxl`: `pip install openpyxl`
2. ✅ Create `.env` file with credentials
3. ✅ Run bot: `python safetybot.py`
4. ✅ Wait 5 minutes for first event check
5. ✅ Test `/getid` command
6. ✅ Verify `events_data/` directory created
7. ✅ Check Excel files generated
8. ✅ Monitor `safetybot.log` for errors

### 📋 Migration Notes for Existing Users

**From v2.1 → v3.0:**

1. **Stop the current bot** - It sends messages we no longer need
2. **Install openpyxl** - `pip install openpyxl==3.10.0`
3. **Backup old logs** - Old behavior is different now
4. **Update `.env`** - No changes needed to credentials
5. **Update automation** - If you had scripts expecting messages, they'll need updating
6. **Test `/getid` command** - New feature, make sure it works
7. **Plan for daily Excel** - Update your reporting workflow
8. **Keep event ID tracking** - Still used for deduplication

### 🔔 Breaking Changes

- **⚠️ No more real-time Telegram messages** - Use `/getid` for on-demand or wait for daily report
- **⚠️ No more video downloads** - Focus is on reporting, not immediate alerts
- **⚠️ Telegram message handling** - `/getid` command handler added (not yet fully integrated with Application)
- **⚠️ Performance event types** - Now ALL types included (previously filtered)

### 🐛 Known Issues

- `/getid` command handler exists but Application object not fully initialized (minimal impact - command can still be called)
- Daily schedule time (23:59) is fixed - user must edit code to change

### 📈 Future Roadmap (v4.0+)

- [ ] Database storage instead of JSON files
- [ ] Advanced filtering and search
- [ ] Custom column selection for Excel
- [ ] Email delivery of reports
- [ ] Web dashboard
- [ ] Historical analytics
- [ ] Alert thresholds per event type
- [ ] Multi-language support
