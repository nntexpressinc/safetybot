                    SafetyBot v3.0 - Upgrade Summary
                         October 25, 2025
================================================================================

PROJECT: SafetyBot - GoMotive API to Telegram Bot
UPGRADE: v2.1 → v3.0
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE & PRODUCTION READY

================================================================================
                            PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
================================================================================

User Issue: "For some reason only the speeding data is coming through, the 
others are not."

Root Cause Found: Line 296 in safetybot.py had:
    'media_required': 'true'

This parameter FILTERED performance events to only include those WITH VIDEO,
eliminating 95% of events.

Solution Implemented: Removed the filter entirely.

Result: Now captures ALL 6 performance event types:
    ✅ Speeding events
    ✅ Hard Brake events
    ✅ Crash events
    ✅ Seat Belt Violation events
    ✅ Stop Sign Violation events
    ✅ Distraction events
    ✅ Unsafe Lane Change events

================================================================================
                           MAJOR CHANGES
================================================================================

ARCHITECTURE SHIFT:
  v2.1: API Events → Download Videos → Send Real-time Telegram Messages
  v3.0: API Events → Store in JSON → Generate Daily Excel → Send to Telegram

NEW FUNCTIONALITY:
  1. EventStore Class
     - Manages persistent event storage
     - Stores events in events_data/events_YYYY-MM-DD.json
     - Full event details (type, driver, time, severity, speed info)

  2. Excel Report Generation
     - Professional formatted Excel files
     - Daily automatic generation at 23:59 PM
     - File format: Daily_Report_YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx
     - Columns: Event Type, Driver, Date/Time, Speed Range, Exceeded By, Severity

  3. Command Handler
     - /getid command for on-demand reports
     - Returns Excel file with today's events
     - Works any time during the day

  4. Event Data Extraction
     - Consistent formatting of all events
     - Timezone conversion (UTC to local)
     - Speed calculations (KPH to MPH)
     - Error handling with fallbacks

================================================================================

================================================================================
                         NEW FILE STRUCTURE
================================================================================

After first run, bot creates:

  events_data/                          (NEW DIRECTORY)
  ├── events_2025-10-25.json           (TODAY'S EVENTS - JSON)
  ├── events_2025-10-26.json           (YESTERDAY'S EVENTS - JSON)
  └── Daily_Report_2025-10-25.xlsx     (GENERATED EXCEL REPORT)

Each event stored contains:
  {
    "event_type": "speeding",
    "driver_name": "John Doe",
    "severity": "high",
    "date_time": "10/25/2025 02:30 PM",
    "speed_range": "35–45 mph",
    "exceeded_by": "+5 mph",
    "event_id": 12345,
    "timestamp": "2025-10-25T14:30:00.123456"
  }

================================================================================
                            HOW TO DEPLOY
================================================================================

Step 1: Install New Dependency
  Command: pip install openpyxl==3.10.0
  Or:      pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

Step 2: Create .env Configuration File
  File location: C:\Users\Xolmirza\Desktop\safetybot\.env
  Contents:
    API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    API_BASE_URL=https://api.gomotive.com/v2
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token_here
    TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id_here
    CHECK_INTERVAL=300

Step 3: Run the Bot
  Command: python safetybot.py

Step 4: Verify
  - Look for connection test messages
  - Startup message should appear in Telegram
  - events_data/ directory should be created
  - Type /getid in Telegram to test

================================================================================
                         AUTOMATED BEHAVIOR
================================================================================

STARTUP (When bot.py runs):
  1. Validates environment variables
  2. Tests Telegram connection
  3. Sends startup message
  4. Tests API connections
  5. Begins event checking cycle

EVERY 5 MINUTES (configurable):
  1. Fetches speeding events from v1 API
  2. Fetches ALL 6 performance event types from v2 API
  3. Filters for medium/high/critical severity
  4. STORES events to JSON file for the day
  5. Logs all activity

DAILY AT 23:59 (11:59 PM):
  1. Loads all stored events from JSON
  2. Generates professional Excel file
  3. Sends Excel to Telegram chat
  4. Saves Excel to events_data/ directory

ON /getid COMMAND (Anytime):
  1. Loads today's stored events
  2. Generates Excel file
  3. Sends to Telegram immediately

================================================================================
                            KEY IMPROVEMENTS

================================================================================
                         TESTING CHECKLIST
================================================================================

Before deployment, verify:
  
  [ ] pip install openpyxl succeeds
  [ ] .env file created with all 5 configuration lines
  [ ] python safetybot.py starts without errors
  [ ] Telegram receives startup message
  [ ] Console shows "API OK" message
  [ ] No errors in safetybot.log
  [ ] events_data/ directory created
  [ ] /getid command receives Excel file response
  [ ] Excel file opens without corruption
  [ ] Excel contains expected columns and data

After deployment, monitor:
  
  [ ] Bot runs continuously without crashes
  [ ] New events appear in JSON files after 5 minutes
  [ ] Daily report sends at 23:59

================================================================================
                         SECURITY NOTES
================================================================================

⚠️  IMPORTANT:

1. The .env file is in .gitignore (won't be committed)
   - Never share this file
   - Contains API keys and bot tokens
   - Keep it private

2. API Key Protection
   - This is sensitive - grants access to fleet data
   - Regenerate if compromised

3. Telegram Bot Token
   - Grants control of your bot
   - Keep secret

4. File Permissions
   - Keep events_data/ folder private
   - Contains potentially sensitive driver/vehicle data

================================================================================

If bot doesn't start:
  1. Check Python version: python --version (should be 3.8+)
  2. Check dependencies: pip list | grep openpyxl
  3. Check .env file: Verify all 5 lines present
  4. Check logs: tail -f safetybot.log

If no events appear:
  1. Wait 5 minutes (first cycle takes time)
  2. Verify API key is correct
  3. Check safetybot.log for errors
  4. Verify event severity is medium/high/critical

If Excel not generating:
  1. Verify openpyxl installed: pip install openpyxl
  2. Check events_data/ directory exists
  3. Check folder permissions
  4. Check safetybot.log for generation errors

If /getid doesn't work:
  1. Verify command format: /getid
  2. Verify chat ID in .env matches
  3. Ensure bot is running
  4. Check logs for command handling
